![A screen shot of the Thikrya demo app's window](thikrya_window_snapshot.png)What is it?-----------Thikrya is a prototype for a next-generation code editor. The idea is to makethis a GUI like Automator or Scratch that can also be edited using the keyboard,by effectively having an implementation of auto-completion that generates the GUIelements.Beyond that stated purpose, it is also useful as an example of how to implementyour own text editing view on Mac OS X, and currently should handle most thingscorrectly, except for right-to-left scripts.License-------	Copyright 2015 by Uli Kusterer.		This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied	warranty.
